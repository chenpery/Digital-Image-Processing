# Digital-Image-Processing
The purpose of this is a self-contained introduction to modern techniques in image processing. We will understand concepts involved in acquiring, sampling, representing, compressing, and processing of multi-dimensional signals (images and videos). We will discuss the notion of inverse problems and ways to solve them â€“ from traditional prior-based methods to modern learning-based methods. Finally, apart from the standard image acquisition model, we will also look at more exotic computational and medical imaging schemes and understand the challenges and applications involved there within.
